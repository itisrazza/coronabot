# CoronaClub Discord Bot (aka Coronification)

Here lies the source code for the CoronaClub Discord bot.

This is a haphazardly cobbled together collection of code to provide some useful information while studying during the 2019-2020 Wuhan Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.

## Background

## Functionality

## Up'n Go

To get this going, `nodejs` and `npm` need to be installed. After that, the usual:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:thegreatrazz/coronication.git
$ cd coronication
$ npm install
$ npm start /path/to/api-key.txt
```

The Discord bot token needs to be saved to a text file and passed to `npm start`.
